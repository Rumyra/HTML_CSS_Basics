# Buttons

Another clickable element is the button element:

`<button>Play</button>`

This is used for interaction within the page itself.

Sometimes it can get a litle confusing because you may have link, just like we saw in the previous video, that looks like a button. They are different elements and if you want to know which one to write, just ask yourself what is this thing doing?

When I click on it, is it taking me somewhere else, if it is it's an anchor. If it's got other functionality, such as closing a popup, playing a video or controlling a game, it's a button element.
