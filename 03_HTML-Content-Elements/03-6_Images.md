# Images

There are pictures all over the place, so we should work out how to include those. We saw a sneak preview of this at the beginning of the course.

The image element is typed img, and is special because it is _self closing_ which means we don't need to write the element twice to close it.

`<img />`

We do however need to include two specific attributes. The source attribute and the alt attribute. The source attribute specifies the image file itself, and the alt attribute value is alternative text for the image, describing it, in case for any reason the user can not see it.

`<img src="myimage.jpg" alt="A photo of something and something" />`

When you write the image element you _must_ remember both of these attributes, otherwise the element is not valid.

Now we've got some content within our page, let's take a look at how we group that content with HTML inthe next chapter.
