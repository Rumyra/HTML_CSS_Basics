# Headers

All areas of your web page or web app can be defined by different sectioning elements in HTML. In this next chapter we going to overview all of these elements and where best to use them to structure your page.

The first and probably easiest to spot is a `header` element, not to be confused with the _headings_ we saw from the previous chapter, those were to define worded content.

_Headers_ section off the top part of content, giving the rest of the section meaning. Probably the most obvious one in a webpage is the big header at the top.

`<header></header>`

Sectioning elements always contain other content elements. The main page header would usually contain the title of the website. As we learned in the previous chapter, this would be an `h1` element.

```html
<header>
	<h1>My Cool Site</h1>
</header>
```

Headers are also used to depict beginning content for other sections as well. You can use as many as you want throughout a page, however you can not use a header within a header.
