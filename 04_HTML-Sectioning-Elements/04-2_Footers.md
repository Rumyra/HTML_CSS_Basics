# Footers

As well as headers we have footers, to encolse information about that area of a web page. Like copyright data, further links or author information.

Most web pages have a footer, just like they have a header. But just like the `header` element you can use a footer within any area of the page. You can not have a footer within a footer however.

```html
<footer>
	<p>&copy; Copyright me 2019</p>
</footer>
```
