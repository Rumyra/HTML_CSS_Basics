# Articles

Articles are standalone parts of content. They contain a header to describe what the content is and can contain a footer as well. They can also contain other sectioning elements.

The most obvious examples are content such as blog posts or news articles, but it can go beyond that. We could use one for the 'About' section on a web page, it has a header and other content such as images or paragaphs. All of this could be wrapped in an article element.

```html
<article>
	<header>
		<h2>About</h2>
	</header>

	<p>This is about this website</p>
</article>
```
